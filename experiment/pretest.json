        "a": "Estimating a range of values within which the true parameter is likely to fall.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. Point estimation involves estimating the true parameter with a single value.",
        "b": "Point estimation involves estimating the true parameter with a single value, such as the sample mean or sample proportion."

        "a": "Interval estimation involves estimating a range of values within which the true parameter is likely to fall, using confidence intervals.",

      "question": "What is a confidence interval?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A range of values that estimates the true parameter with a high level of confidence.",
        "b": "A range of values that estimates the true parameter with a low level of confidence."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A confidence interval is a range of values that estimates the true parameter with a high level of confidence, typically expressed as a percentage.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. A confidence interval estimates the true parameter with a high level of confidence, not a low level of confidence."

      "answers": {
        "a": "The range of values within which the true parameter is likely to fall.",
        "b": "The maximum amount by which the point estimate may differ from the true parameter."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The margin of error is the maximum amount by which the point estimate may differ from the true parameter.",
        "b": "The margin of error is the maximum amount by which the point estimate may differ from the true parameter, and it is used to construct the confidence interval."

      "question": "What is the sample size needed to decrease the width of a confidence interval?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Increase the sample size.",
        "b": "Decrease the sample size."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "To decrease the width of a confidence interval, you need to increase the sample size. A larger sample size provides more information and reduces the uncertainty in the estimate.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. Decreasing the sample size would not help decrease the width of a confidence interval; in fact, it may increase the uncertainty in the estimate."
