      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Point estimation aims to provide a single, best guess for a population parameter, not a range of values.",
        "b": "Correct! Point estimation involves estimating a specific value (point estimate) for a population parameter based on sample data.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Point estimation is not focused on determining the variability within a dataset.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Point estimation is not concerned with identifying outliers in the sample data.",

        "a": "To specify the exact value of a population parameter.",
