        "a": "Estimating the parameters by equating the sample moments to the population moments.",
        "b": "Estimating the parameters by calculating the range of values within which they are likely to fall."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The method of moments estimation involves estimating the parameters by equating the sample moments (such as the sample mean and variance) to the population moments.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. The method of moments estimation does not involve calculating the range of values for the parameters; it relies on equating sample moments to population moments."

      "question": "What is the maximum likelihood estimation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Estimating the parameters by maximizing the likelihood function.",
        "b": "Estimating the parameters by minimizing the sum of squared errors."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Maximum likelihood estimation involves estimating the parameters by maximizing the likelihood function, which measures the probability of observing the given data.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. Maximum likelihood estimation does not involve minimizing the sum of squared errors; it focuses on maximizing the likelihood function to find the most likely parameter values."

      "question": "What is the bias of an estimator?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The degree to which the estimator consistently underestimates the true parameter.",
        "b": "The degree to which the estimator consistently overestimates the true parameter."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. Bias refers to the systematic deviation of the estimator from the true parameter, whether it consistently underestimates or overestimates it.",
        "b": "Bias refers to the systematic deviation of the estimator from the true parameter, whether it consistently underestimates or overestimates it."

      "question": "What is the mean squared error (MSE) of an estimator?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The average squared difference between the estimator and the true parameter.",
        "b": "The average absolute difference between the estimator and the true parameter."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The mean squared error (MSE) is the average squared difference between the estimator and the true parameter. It measures the overall accuracy and precision of the estimator.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. The mean squared error (MSE) specifically calculates the squared difference, not the absolute difference, between the estimator and the true parameter."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The method of confidence intervals involves estimating the parameters by calculating the range of values (confidence interval) within which they are likely to fall, based on sample data.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. The method of confidence intervals is not about maximizing the likelihood function; it focuses on constructing ranges of values (confidence intervals) to estimate the parameters."
