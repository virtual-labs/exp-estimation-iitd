        "a": "The distribution of the sample data.",
        "b": "The distribution of the population data."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The sampling distribution is not the distribution of the sample data itself.",
        "b": "The sampling distribution is the distribution of statistics (e.g., means or proportions) calculated from different samples taken from the same population."

      "question": "What is the standard error of the mean?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The standard deviation of the population.",
        "b": "The standard deviation of the sample.",
        "c": "The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample means."

        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The standard error of the mean is not the standard deviation of the population.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. The standard error of the mean is not the standard deviation of the sample.",
        "c": "The standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample means, and it measures the precision of the sample mean as an estimator of the population mean."

      "question": "What is the formula for calculating a 95% confidence interval for a population mean?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Sample mean ± 1.96 * standard error",
        "b": "Sample mean ± 1.645 * standard error",
        "c": "Sample mean ± 2.576 * standard error"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The formula for calculating a 95% confidence interval for a population mean is sample mean ± 1.96 * standard error. This corresponds to a confidence level of approximately 95%.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. The value 1.645 corresponds to a smaller confidence level, such as 90%.",
        "c": "This statement is incorrect. The value 2.576 corresponds to a larger confidence level, such as 99%."

      "question": "What is the formula for calculating a 90% confidence interval for a population proportion?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Sample proportion ± 1.96 * standard error",
        "b": "Sample proportion ± 1.645 * standard error",
        "c": "Sample proportion ± 1.282 * standard error"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The formula for calculating a 90% confidence interval for a population proportion uses a different critical value, corresponding to a different confidence level.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. The value 1.645 corresponds to a 90% confidence level.",
        "c": "The formula for calculating a 90% confidence interval for a population proportion is sample proportion ± 1.282 * standard error. This corresponds to a confidence level of approximately 90%."

      "question": "What is the concept of sampling variability?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The tendency of a sample statistic to fluctuate from one sample to another.",
        "b": "The tendency of a sample statistic to remain constant across different samples."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The concept of sampling variability refers to the tendency of a sample statistic to fluctuate from one sample to another due to random sampling. This variability is expected and can be quantified.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. Sampling variability refers to the fluctuation of a sample statistic, not its constancy."
