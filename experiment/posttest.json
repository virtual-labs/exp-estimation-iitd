      "question": "A researcher wants to estimate the average time spent by people on a new app. A sample of 200 users showed an average usage time of 15 minutes with a standard deviation of 3 minutes. What is the 90% confidence interval for the average usage time on the app?",

        "b": "14.7 to 15.3 minutes",
        "c": "13.9 to 16.1 minutes",
        "d": "14.1 to 15.9 minutes"

        "a": "Incorrect. This interval is not calculated correctly.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This interval is not calculated correctly.",
        "c": "Correct! The 90% confidence interval for the average usage time is calculated as 13.9 to 16.1 minutes.",
